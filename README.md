# Lab 3 Redesign

In Lab 3 (https://github.com/eharada/Data_Viz_Lab_3), I created a visualization that shows the aggregate data breaches per year and the corresponding stock prices. In the visuals, it is visible that financial markets do not punish security breaches.

The advantage of this graph is that the audience is able to see when the data breaches occurred and the overall trend of the stock prices. However, it is confusing to see two graphs and the audience may not know how the graphs are related if it's not explained to them. 

<br/><br/>

For the redesign, I'm planning on having one graph that supports the claim that financial markets do not punish companies after security breaches. Additionally I'm going to exclude outliers for data breaches as those skew the data.
